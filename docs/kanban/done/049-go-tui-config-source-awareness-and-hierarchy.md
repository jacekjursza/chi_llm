# 049: Go TUI Config Source Awareness and Hierarchy â€” Retired

Status: Retired (Go TUI removed in favor of Rust/ratatui)

Outcome:
- Config source awareness to be implemented in Rust TUI diagnostics and configure screens.

Notes:
- Historical TODO moved to Done to avoid duplicates across columns.
