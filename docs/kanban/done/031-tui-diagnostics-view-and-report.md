# TUI Diagnostics View & Report â€” Done

## Outcome
- Added diagnostics view (hotkey `d`) and export (`e`) in Textual UI.
- Store APIs: `get_diagnostics()` and `export_diagnostics(path)`.
- Tests for diagnostics retrieval and export.

## Notes
- Focus on Python/runtime, cache, model fit, and HF reachability.
- No Node.js dependency or checks needed in UI.
