Title: TUI Config – unified view polish (Closed: superseded by Go TUI migration)

Decision
- Python Textual TUI enters maintenance mode. This card is closed and replaced by Go TUI parity work.

Replaced By
- 039 Go TUI – Config view parity

Context (original)
- The unified Config view lacked a Back action to return to Home.
- Provider selection, scope toggle, and status feedback existed but needed minor UX polish.

Notes
- All new TUI work continues in `go-chi/`.
