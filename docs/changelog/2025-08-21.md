# 2025-08-21

- Initialized Kanban structure and roadmap skeleton.
- Added first TODO: Refactor CLI into modular subcommands.
- Updated AGENTS.md with product sources and DX/testing notes.
- Decision: `docs_tmp/*` may remain in Polish as temporary drafts.

### Tooling and Lint
- Added pre-commit hooks (black, ruff, file-length, commit-msg) and dev tooling.
- Configured Ruff with tests excluded; added `.lengthcheckignore` for `chi_llm/cli.py` until refactor.

### Lint Cleanup
- Core modules cleanup (utils, analyzer, core init, setup, rag): long lines, imports, bare excepts.
- Examples cleanup: remove unused vars, avoid bare except.
