# Changelog â€” Kanban cleanup (card 016)

- Removed duplicate Kanban card `016-docs-examples-providers-and-routing.md` from `docs/kanban/inprogress/`.
- Single source of truth kept in `docs/kanban/done/` per strict Kanban rules.

Context:
- Avoids duplicates across columns (TODO/In Progress/Done) to keep workflow consistent.
