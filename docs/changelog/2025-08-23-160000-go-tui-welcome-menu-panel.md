# Feature: Go TUI Welcome Screen Menu Panel

## Overview
Replaced the complex Table of Contents panel with an elegant menu panel on the Welcome screen's left side, providing clear navigation and action shortcuts.

## Implementation Details

### Menu Structure
- **Navigation Section**: Direct page access (1-3)
  - [1] Welcome
  - [2] Configure Provider
  - [3] Diagnostics
- **Actions Section**: Common operations
  - [b] Build - Build configuration
  - [?] Help - Toggle help
  - [q] Quit - Exit application

### Key Changes

#### Keyboard Shortcuts Reorganization
- **ESC**: Now serves as universal "back" button (previously 'b')
- **b**: Opens Build Configuration page (moved from navigation)
- **3**: Opens Diagnostics (previously '4')
- Removed theme toggle ('t') and animation toggle ('a') from actions

#### Panel Layout
- Left panel: 33% width with menu content
- Right panel: 67% width with viewport content
- Vertical separator between panels
- Line-by-line rendering for proper alignment

### Visual Design
- Current page highlighted with `▸` indicator
- Clean section separators using `─` lines
- Minimalist styling for better readability
- No external component dependencies

## Files Modified
- `go-chi/internal/tui/model.go`:
  - Added `renderMenu()` function for menu panel
  - Updated View() to show menu in left panel
  - Modified keyboard handling for new shortcuts
- `go-chi/internal/tui/keys.go`:
  - Changed Back key from 'b' to 'esc'
  - Updated Sec3 to map to Diagnostics
  - Updated Sec4 to map to Build (key 'b')

## Testing
- Built successfully with `go build ./cmd/chi-tui`
- All navigation shortcuts work correctly
- Menu displays properly with current page highlighting
- ESC key provides consistent back navigation

## User Benefits
1. **Clear Navigation**: All pages accessible from single menu
2. **Consistent Actions**: Common operations always visible
3. **Better Organization**: Logical separation of navigation and actions
4. **Simplified Interface**: Removed rarely-used theme/animation toggles
5. **Improved Shortcuts**: ESC for back is more intuitive

## Evolution from TOC
This implementation evolved from an initial Table of Contents feature that parsed markdown headers. The simpler menu approach provides better usability without the complexity of document parsing and section management.
