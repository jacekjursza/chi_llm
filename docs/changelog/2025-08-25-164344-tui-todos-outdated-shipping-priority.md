# TUI Planning Note — Shipping Priority over Outdated TODOs

- Context: Some historical TUI TODO cards are no longer aligned with the current direction.
- Decision: Prioritize shipping the current Rust TUI feature set (core flows, tmp→final build, provider E2E test) over non-essential polish.
- Actioned:
  - Roadmap note updated (docs/product/current/roadmap.md).
  - TUI README updated with "Status & Priorities" section.

Rationale: Reduce churn and focus on delivering a cohesive, working TUI.
