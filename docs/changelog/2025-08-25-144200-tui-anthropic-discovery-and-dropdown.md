title: TUI â€” Anthropic discovery + OpenAI/Anthropic model dropdown

- Added `providers discover-models --type anthropic` (uses x-api-key and anthropic-version headers).
- TUI probe now tests Anthropic and shows model count; Save gating treats Anthropic as tested when successful.
- Dynamic `model` dropdown added for OpenAI and Anthropic in Providers form (via CLI discovery).
