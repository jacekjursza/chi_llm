Title: 033 â€“ TUI Config unified view polish
Date: 2025-08-22

Changes
- Config view: added Back action to return to Home.
- Minor UX polish: explicit scope label updates; clearer status messages.
- Docs: updated CLI section with Config UI usage and actions.

Context
- Focus on TUI as a priority. This is a small UX improvement that makes navigation clearer and keeps the view cohesive for provider and scope operations.
