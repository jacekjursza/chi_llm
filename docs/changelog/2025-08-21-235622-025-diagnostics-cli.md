# 025: Diagnostics CLI

## Summary
- Added `chi-llm diagnostics` with `--json` for environment checks.
- Checks include: Python, Node/npm, cache dir, current model vs available RAM, and basic Hugging Face reachability.

## Rationale
Enables the Ink UI to render actionable diagnostics via stable JSON, fulfilling the diagnostics part of the UI MVP.

## Notes
- Network check is best-effort and mocked in tests.
- No breaking changes to existing commands.
