# Feature: Go TUI Table of Contents Panel

## Overview
Added a Table of Contents (TOC) panel to the Go TUI Welcome screen that displays markdown headers from the README and allows section-based navigation.

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures
- Added `TOCItem` struct to represent document sections with level, title, content, and line number
- Extended `Model` struct with TOC state fields: `tocItems`, `tocIndex`, `tocFocused`, `showTOC`, `currentSection`

### Markdown Parsing
- Implemented `parseTOC()` function that:
  - Extracts headers using regex pattern `^(#{1,6})\s+(.+)$`
  - Splits document into sections (from each header to the next)
  - Preserves header hierarchy with level information
  - Falls back to single "Document" section if no headers found

### UI Layout
- TOC panel appears on the left (25% width, capped at 20-40 chars)
- Content viewport on the right (75% width)
- Vertical separator between panels
- Responsive to terminal resizing

### Navigation Features
- **Tab**: Toggle focus between TOC and content viewport
- **h**: Toggle TOC visibility (hide/show)
- **Arrow keys / k/j**: Navigate TOC items when focused, scroll content when not
- **Enter**: Select TOC item and display its section
- **Escape**: Return focus to content from TOC
- **Page navigation**: PgUp/PgDn/Space work on content when not in TOC

### Visual Feedback
- Selected TOC item shown with `▸` indicator
- Current section marked with `•` indicator
- Focused panel has highlighted styling
- Header indentation based on level (h2 indented, h3 more, etc.)
- Status line shows current focus and section info

### Section-Based Content
- Each section loaded independently into viewport
- Viewport resets to top when switching sections
- Maintains full document if TOC parsing fails

## Files Modified
- `go-chi/internal/tui/model.go`:
  - Added TOCItem struct and TOC state fields
  - Implemented `parseTOC()` function
  - Added `renderTOC()` function for panel rendering
  - Updated keyboard handling for TOC navigation
  - Modified View() to render split panels with `lipgloss.JoinHorizontal()`
  - Updated NewModel() to initialize TOC on startup

## Testing
- Built successfully with `go build ./cmd/chi-tui`
- All tests pass with `go test ./...`
- Manual testing confirms:
  - TOC displays all README headers correctly
  - Navigation between sections works smoothly
  - Focus switching behaves as expected
  - TOC can be hidden/shown with 'h' key

## User Benefits
1. **Quick Navigation**: Jump directly to any section without scrolling
2. **Document Overview**: See document structure at a glance
3. **Context Awareness**: Always know current position in document
4. **Keyboard Friendly**: Full keyboard navigation support
5. **Flexible**: Can hide TOC for full-width reading

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Search within TOC
- Bookmarking sections
- Collapsible header groups
- Mouse click support for TOC items
- Remember last viewed section
