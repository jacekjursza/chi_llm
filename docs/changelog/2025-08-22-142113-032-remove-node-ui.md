# Remove Node/Ink UI (032)

## Summary
- Removed legacy Node/Ink UI and all related assets/flags.
- `chi-llm config` now launches the Textual UI exclusively.

## Details
- Deleted `chi_llm/ui_frontend` and manifest entry.
- Simplified `chi_llm/cli_modules/ui.py` to Textual-only; removed `--legacy-node`.
- Updated README and `docs/CLI.md` to Textual instructions.
- Adjusted tests to remove Node-specific behavior.

## Rationale
- Early development, 0 external users: simplify stack and reduce flakiness by dropping Node dependency.
